          </a>Point Of Interest Mod for <a href="http://www.nerdkingdom.com/">TUG</a>
        </h1>

<p><strong>Version 0.2.4</strong></p>

<!--
<h2>
<a name="required-tug-version" class="anchor" href="#required-tug-version"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Required TUG version</h2>
-->

<p><strong>This version of Point Of Interest mod works with TUG alpha build 0.8.4.</strong></p>

<h2>
<a name="what-it-is" class="anchor" href="#what-it-is"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What it is?</h2>

<p>The mod allows players to mark certain locations as Points of Interest in order to help find those locations easily again on a later point. </p>

<p><em>Note: This is quite early version of the mod, and not everything is working just yet.</em></p>

<p>It adds an invisible PointOfInterest.lua gameobject that player and other mods can spawn to the world (via this mod). The mod then keeps track of these objects and their location in relation to player.</p>

<p>Most importantly it adds a compass to show the markers.</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-do-you-use-it" class="anchor" href="#how-do-you-use-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do you use it?</h2>

<!--
<p>Currently it only has very simple command line UI, that supports /slashcommands. This will be changing in the future.</p>

<p>The /commands are:</p>

<pre><code>/CreatePointOfInterest &lt;name&gt; &lt;description&gt; &lt;category&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Creates an invisible Point of Interest object at the player's current position. Currently name, description and category can only contain a single word each. This is only a limitation of the current console UI and will change soon.</p>

<pre><code>/ListPointsOfInterest
</code></pre>

<p>Lists all created Point of Interest objects. It shows the objects id and name.</p>

<pre><code>/DistanceToPointOfInterest &lt;id&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Shows the distance between player's current location and Point of Interest identified by its ID.</p>

<pre><code>/DirectionToPointOfInterest &lt;id&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Shows the direction of Point of Interest identified by its ID.</p>

<pre><code>/RemovePointOfInterest &lt;id&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Removes the Point of Interest object matching the ID given as parameter for the command.</p>

<p>The command line UI is very simplistic and is designed to be replaced with a real graphical UI in the near future.</p>
-->

<p>
The compass shows you the main directions, and any created markers for Points of Interest that you have decided to mark down.
</p>

<p>
New Points of Interest are creted by clicking the blue stone like button on the right side of the compass.

<h2>
<a name="known-bugs" class="anchor" href="#known-bugs"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Known bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li>This is dev build, and because of that there might be game breaking bugs left.</li>
<li>There is no way to limit what PoI markers are shown on compass. Currently everything is shown, which gets messy after couple of markers.</li>
</ul>


<h2>
<a name="what-is-coming-later" class="anchor" href="#what-is-coming-later"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is coming later?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Possibility to add name, description and different icon for created PointsOfInterests in GUI. Already possible in code.</li>
  <li>Way to show the name of PoI to player. This will possibly be shown above compass when targeting PoI and when reaching it. Gramma's recipes style.</li>
  <li>Way to list and edit existing Points of Interest.</li>
  <li>Limit visible markers by their distance. Show only nearest n markers, or markers inside radius of m.</li>
</ul>

<p>The UI part of the mod is separated from the rest of the mods functionality. This way it's very simple to create new UIs for the mod. The current console UI will become optional when the graphical UI will be implemented. As this is very early version the methods and object names are subject to change in the future.</p>

<h3>
<a name="where-to-install" class="anchor" href="#where-to-install"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where to install</h3>

<p>Copy all the files into a Mods file under your TUG installation. If you are using Steam, TUG is probably installed at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\common\TUG. Under this folder create a folder called 'Mods', if you already don't have one. Inside the Mods folder, create folder 'PointOfInterest' and copy all of this mods files under it.</p>

<p>Easiest way to do this is to download the mod as zip, by clicking the link on this page, and extract everything under \mods. After this just rename the generated folder as 'PointOfInterest'.</p>

<p>In addition to this, you have to edit the file \config\mods.txt and add it the following row below other similar lines:</p>

<pre><code>  "Mods/PointOfInterest"
</code></pre>

<p>So that it looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>Mods
{
  "Game/Survival"
  "Game/Creative"
  "Game/Core"
  "Mods/PointOfInterest"
}
</code></pre>
