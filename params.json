{"name":"Pointofinterest Mod","tagline":"Mod for TUG that adds a new Points of Interest system to make it easier to mark interesting locations","body":"# Point Of Interest Mod for [TUG](http://www.nerdkingdom.com/)\r\n\r\n## What it is?\r\n\r\nIt is a mod that allows players to mark certain locations as Points of Interest, and allows them a way to find those locations easily again on a later point. *This is very early version of the mod and is not currently recommended for actual use.*\r\n\r\nIt adds an invisible PointOfInterest.lua gameobject that player or other mods can spawn to the world (via this mod). The mod then keeps track of these objects and their location in relation to player.\r\n\r\n## How do you use it?\r\n\r\nCurrently it only has very simple command line UI, that supports /slashcommands. This will be changing in the future. \r\n\r\nThe /commands are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/CreatePointOfInterest <name> <description> <category>\r\n/ListPointsOfInterest\r\n/DistanceToPointOfInterest <id>\r\n/DirectionToPointOfInterest <id>\r\n/RemovePointOfInterest <id>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe command line UI is very simplistic and is designed to be replaced with a real graphical UI in the near future.\r\n\r\n## What is coming later?\r\n\r\n* Way to load and save Points of Interest. Currently all of the data is flushed away when new world is loaded/created.\r\n* Graphical UI that will make it far easier to move between different Points of Interest.\r\n\r\n## How can I create my own UI for the mod?\r\n\r\nThe UI part of the mod is separated from the rest of the mods functionality. This way it's very simple to create new UIs for the mod. The current console UI will become optional when the graphical UI will be implemented. As this is very early version the methods and object names are subject to change in the future.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n**This is very early version of the mod and is not intended for real use yet.** The mod requires you to edit certain core game files. This will change in the future, but for now, it's recommended that you only edit these files if you know what you are doing.\r\n\r\n### Where to install\r\n\r\nCopy all the files into a Mods file under your TUG installation. If you are using Steam, TUG is probably installed at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\Steamapps\\common\\TUG. Under this folder create a folder called 'Mods', if you already don't have one. Inside the Mods folder, create folder 'PointOfInterest' and copy all of this mods files under it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, you have to edit the file <your TUG folder>\\config\\mods.txt and add it the following row below other similar lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"Mods/PointOfInterest\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that it looks something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMods\r\n{\r\n  \"Game/Survival\"\r\n  \"Game/Creative\"\r\n  \"Game/Core\"\r\n  \"Mods/PointOfInterest\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, you need to edit Survival.lua file at <Your TUG folder>\\Core\\Scripts\\Modes\\Survival\\Survival.lua. **Don't do this unless you know what you are doing**, as it might break your game. If it does that, installing the game from a fresh will make your game work again, but you might lose any changes you have done.\r\n\r\nAdd the following lines to the end of Survival.lua or any other GameMode class you want to use the mod in:\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------- PointOfInterest mods code starts here ----------------\r\n\r\ninclude(\"Scripts/PointOfInterestMain.lua\")\r\ninclude(\"Scripts/UI/PointOfInterestConsoleUI.lua\")\r\n\r\n -- Register /commands\r\nSurvival:RegisterSlashCommand(\"CreatePointOfInterest\", \"CreatePointOfInterest\")\r\nSurvival:RegisterSlashCommand(\"ListPointsOfInterest\", \"ListPointsOfInterest\")\r\nSurvival:RegisterSlashCommand(\"RemovePointOfInterest\", \"RemovePointOfInterest\")\r\nSurvival:RegisterSlashCommand(\"DistanceToPointOfInterest\", \"DistanceToPointOfInterest\")\r\nSurvival:RegisterSlashCommand(\"DirectionToPointOfInterest\", \"DirectionToPointOfInterest\")\r\n\r\n-- Create methods for /commands\r\nfunction Survival:CreatePointOfInterest(args)\r\n  NKPrint(\"\\nCreatePointOfInterest custom slash command was called\\n\")\r\n  if EternusEngine.PointOfInterestUI then\r\n    EternusEngine.PointOfInterestUI:CreatePointOfInterest(args)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nfunction Survival:ListPointsOfInterest(args)\r\n  NKPrint(\"\\nListPointsOfInterest custom slash command was called\\n\")\r\n  if EternusEngine.PointOfInterestUI then\r\n    EternusEngine.PointOfInterestUI:ListPointsOfInterest(args)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nfunction Survival:RemovePointOfInterest(args)\r\n  NKPrint(\"\\nRemovePointOfInterest custom slash command was called\\n\")\r\n  if EternusEngine.PointOfInterestUI then\r\n    EternusEngine.PointOfInterestUI:RemovePointOfInterest(args)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nfunction Survival:DirectionToPointOfInterest(args)\r\n  NKPrint(\"\\nDirectionToPointOfInterest custom slash command was called\\n\")\r\n  if EternusEngine.PointOfInterestUI then\r\n    EternusEngine.PointOfInterestUI:DirectionToPointOfInterest(args[1])\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nfunction Survival:DistanceToPointOfInterest(args)\r\n  NKPrint(\"\\nDistanceToPointOfInterest custom slash command was called\\n\")\r\n  if EternusEngine.PointOfInterestUI then\r\n    EternusEngine.PointOfInterestUI:DistanceToPointOfInterest(args[1])\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n---------------- PointOfInterest mods code ends here ------------------\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
